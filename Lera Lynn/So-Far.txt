And never even faced you eye to eye

But I can′t remember why I left you today
Today you're another life, a happy memory far away
So far away

Time, time, time, has worn away the clarity
Has worn away the reasons why I cried
So why, why, why, did I feel the pull to break free?
Can someone remind me how we died?

'Cause I can′t remember why I left you today
Today you′re another life, a happy memory far away
So far away

Here's hoping tomorrow frames a portrait of our dooms day

Because I can′t remember why I left you today
Today you're another life, a happy memory far away

I can′t remember why I left you today
Today you're another life, a happy memory far away
Far away, so far away
