And eyes that would tempt any man

And she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
Well I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and he whispered, "I need you,
Let me take you away from here and be your man"
And then I looked in his eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home
