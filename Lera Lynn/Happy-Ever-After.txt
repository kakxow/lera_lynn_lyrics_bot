But I hung up soon
Before you even knew
Thinking someone else could be beside you
You can run, you can hide
You can save it all inside
Sooner than later it′ll find you
Yes and maybe it has
Somewhere in the past
But somehow it still slipped by you
Oh it slipped by you
Oh it slipped by you
Well it's not your fault
I pushed you to walk
Straight into the forest of disaster
With a blindfold on
Singing you a song of
Innocence and happy ever after
Well I run and I hide
And I save it all inside
But I know that soon it′ll find me
Yes and maybe it has
Somewhere in the past
But somehow it still slipped by me
Oh it slipped by me
Oh it slipped by me
