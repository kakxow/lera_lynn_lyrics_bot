To push against

Oh-ohhh
Keep speaking
I'm a swirl of love
The funnel of desire
Suckinâ€² at your dust

Shape shifter so no one knows (how to get you on the line, yeah)
Resistor of the easy road (keeps them hanging on your ride, yeah)
You make me wanna hurt you, hurt you, hurt you babe
So I can be the one to shift your shape

Write your name all over my skin
Carve out each letter, then color them in

Oh oh oooh
Shape shifter
Whisper in my ear
Let me feel your breath and
Let me hear

Shape shifter so no one knows (how to get you on the line, yeah)
Resistor of the easy road (keeps them hanging on your ride, yeah)
You make me wanna hurt you, hurt you, hurt you babe
So I can be the one to shift your shape
