They were hanging out, partyin′ fancy free
All sorts of souls in all the colors you could dream
And no one ever spoke except to say to me

Are you listening?
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
There's a song that plays for you, can′t you see?
You wrote the music, you sing the melody

Now on the other side, I still believe
If you swim down deep enough there's room to breathe
Yeah there's dark but there′s light and there′s gold in between
And in the gold I'm told′s a door for you
One that only opens for eyes anew
To a world where love is the only truth

Are you listening?
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
There's a song that plays for you, can′t you see?
You write the music, you sing the melody
Sing the melody
Sing the melody

I know there's something there is something on the other side
Ohhh I feel a spirit moving in me and I can′t deny

Are you listening?
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
There's a song that plays for you, can't you see?
You write the music, you sing the melody
Sing the melody
Sing the melody

I know there′s something there is something on the other side
Ohhh I feel a spirit moving in me and I can′t deny
I feel a spirit moving in me all around us
Something around us and I can't deny

You sing the melody
Sing the melody
Sing the melody
Sing the melody
