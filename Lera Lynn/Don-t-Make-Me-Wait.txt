It pains my neck to look over my shoulder.
My poor heart'll soon be ripped from my sleeve.

Judgeman, come 'n′ lock me away.
I′m lone, brave, broke hack.
Please, let me pay.
Minute by minute, I'm ten years older.
It pains my neck to look over my shoulder.
My poor heart′ll soon be ripped from my sleeve.

So, send me to the gallows,
Burn me at the stake,
But, please, don't make me wait.
