You just say no
You say you don't like it
But, girl, I know you're a liar
′Cause when we kiss
Oh, fire

Late at night
I′m takin' you home
I say I wanna stay
You say you wanna be alone
You say you don′t love me
But you can't hide your desire
′Cause when we kiss
Oh, fire
Fire

You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
Nerves all jumpin′, actin' like a fool
Your kisses, they burn
But your heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Deliliah
You can bet, their love, they didn't deny
Your words say split
But your words, they lie
′Cause when we kiss
Oh, fire
Oh, fire

You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn′t tear it apart
Nerves all jumpin', actin′ like a fool
Well, your kisses, they burn
But your heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Deliliah
You can bet, their love, they couldn't deny
Your words say split
But your words, they lie
′Cause when we kiss
Oh, fire
Fire
Fire
Oh, fire
Oh, fiiiire
