We play dead inside to hide
We′re chained to something sharp and wild
We're holding hands and twisting knives
Staring without blinking into each other′s eyes
Love through suffering and sacrifice in bliss
Remember this in misery, through every scratch and hiss
Reconnect and disconnect dissect in obtuse angles
Undercover angered lovers, please don't cry don't cry
We lay in our bed and dread
We′re chained to something underfed
We′re holding hands and twisting knives
Staring without blinking into each other's eyes
Love through suffering and sacrifice in bliss
Remember this in misery, through every scratch and hiss
Fanged hounds, we throw down
Fight to win we′ll never understand the purpose
Round and round, we fall down
What now keeps us bound is only yearning
To be found, and feel the burning
Maybe even love deserving
We're holding hands
We′re holding hands and twisting knives
Staring without blinking into each other's eyes
Love through suffering and sacrifice in bliss
Remember this in misery, through every scratch and hiss
We′re holding hands
We're holding hands
