I sail to find my love so dear
Once lost in an ocean swell
Somewhere near the space between violent skies
And the city here
My love I′ll find again

And as the wind blows hard to steer
Sails in my love it's own
I remember clear
Fingers would dance beyond
Our hemisphere touches all I know

I sail to find my love so dear
Once lost in an ocean swell
Somewhere near the space violent skies
And the city here
My love I′ll find again
