Lately someoneâ€²s missing from now on

Lately I'm not feeling like myself
When I look into the glass I see someone else
I hardly recognize this face I wear
When I stare into her eyes I see no one there
Lately I'm not feeling like myself

The mystery that no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?

The mystery that no one knows
