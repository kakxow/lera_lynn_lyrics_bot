That you're what I'm missing
If I stay any longer
I know what I′ll do
I′ll lose myself in you

I don't wanna lie
But I can′t tell the truth
Most of me wants all of you
I can't give in
Like my body wants to
I′ll lose myself in you

Oh, how I want
Oh, how I need
To let go of us
And hang onto me
Oh, how I want
Oh, how I need

I don't wanna leave
Don′t wanna stay
I want you closer
Then I wanna run away
I can't decide
Ooh, you know what I'll do
I′ll lose myself in you

Oh, how I want
Oh, how I need
To let go of us
And hang onto me
Oh, how I want
Oh, how I need

I′ll lose myself in you
I'll lose myself in you
I′ll lose myself in you
I'll lose myself in you

I′ll lose myself in you
I'll lose myself in you
I′ll lose myself in you
