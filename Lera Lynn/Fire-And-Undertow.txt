And all of my parts must be fed

Funny how the lines so easily fill
When you′re living with a muddy head,
Slide down the hill
Afraid of undertow

It turns my heart,
My head and everything I think I know
The waves carry it away
I'm lost at sea and I have no oar to row

And there′s no way to know baby,
The motion of the sea
You say you'll catch me when I fall

Maybe baby I just need to hit the ground
And if you love me too hard
I may end up making the same, old sound
Just don't be afraid, baby

Afraid of losing me
