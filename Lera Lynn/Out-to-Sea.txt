Take me to the lens to vie
Let the waters rush out to tide
Well, this is all a dream
And I′ll let it all go
Tell me how I should decide
The face of a man who will drive this ride
In fear old men made
Let it all go
I wish I may, I wish I might
Ride this wave 'til morning light
Drop me off at the shore; lay my head down
They say life′s more than what we see
And surely in death there too will be
Just give me one chance
More to lay my head down
The road so short and the jump so high
And falling sounds like a lullaby
The weight of all I know
Let it all go
The fragile land on which we dance
The thread of life, life ducked to chance
Though they'd never know
Let it all go
I wish I may, I wish I might
Ride this wave 'til morning light
Drop me off at the shore; lay my head down
They say life′s more than what we see
And surely in death there too will be
Just give me one chance
More to lay my head down
And if you push me out to sea
Darlin′ won't you breathe in me, breathe
Aah x 2
The road so short and the jump so high
And falling sounds like a lullaby
The road so short and the jump so high
And falling sounds like a lullaby
The road so short and the jump so high (They say life′s more than what we see)
And falling sounds like a lullaby (And surely in death there too will be)
The road so short and the jump so high (They say life's more than what we see)
And falling sounds like a lullaby (And surely in death there too will be)
