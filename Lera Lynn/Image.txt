You can′t escape me
Your hate creates me
I am the cancer to your feminine,
The mother of the serpentine

I am the headline
I am the undermine
I am the voice inside your head.
A screaming child with deadly lead

You give me buzz feed
You sun the bad seed
You crave the endless stream of the sensational and obscene

L'I give it to you
You′re gonna beg me
L'll give you rise and shine and break your legs
I'll drink your fine wine and leave you the dregs

You′re gonna thank me,
Congratulate me
For the mindless image that we′ve made
And the ugly truth we've betrayed
