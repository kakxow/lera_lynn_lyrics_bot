A good place to start

You run in the night
I wait in the light

Six gears for pleasure
And a wheel to the lips
Champagne for sorrow
From broken glass we sip

You run in the night
I wait in the light
In shadows, darkness and I

Music plays a letter by the door
I hope it gives you more

Cashmere for weather
And wool for the eyes
A bed made of feathers
And a mask made of lies

You run in the night
I wait in the light
In shadows, darkness, and I

Music plays a letter by the door
I hope it gives you more
