Transfer my tragedy

Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gonna bust that box, gonna gut that fish

We could jet in a stolen car
Bet we wouldn't get too far
′Fore the transformation takes
And the bloodlust takes
And the crave gets slaked

My mind has changed
My body's frame
But God I like it

My heart's aflame
My body′s strained
But God I like it

My mind has changed
My body′s frame
But God I like it

My heart's aflame
My body′s strained
But God I like it

Charge me your daily rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that′ll blow your mind

Baby doll, I recognize
Your hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you

I know it′s strange
Another way
To get to know you
You'll never know
Unless we go
So let me show you

I know it's strange
Another way
To get to know you
We′ve got to move
Here comes the moon
So let me show you

Show you...

Dream me, oh dreamer
Down to your core
Open my hands
And let them weave onto yours

Feel me, completer
Down to my core
Open my heart
And let it bleed onto yours

Feedin′ on fever
Down on all fours
Show you what all that howlin's for

Hey! Hey! My baby
Let me lay waste to thee
Burn down their hangin′ trees

(Hah-here-hah-here-hah-here-hah-here)

Gotta curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
There's a curse, comes with a kiss
The bite that binds
The gift that gives

Now that we′re gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood
Tell your grandma, mama too
It's true, true, true

My mind has changed
My body′s frame
But God I like it

My heart's aflame
My body's strained
But God I like it

My mind has changed
My body′s frame
But God I like it

My heart′s aflame
My body's strained
But God I like it
