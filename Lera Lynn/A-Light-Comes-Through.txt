Let's forget together what went wrong
And we'd laugh about those better days before you turned

But all this time has made it fade
And now I don′t care about
All these holes that you made
′Cause a light comes through 'em now
Sometimes a light comes through ′em now

Then you'd tell me about where you been
Tales of the cosmos and being born again
And I′d feel an ease settle in
Then I'd play a song on the stereo
One you love, one you know
And when Brenda Lee sings I′m sorry I'd know you are too

But all this time has made it fade
And now I don't care about
All these holes that you made
′Cause a light comes through ′em now
Sometimes a light comes through 'em now

But all this time has made it fade
And now I don′t care about
All these holes that you made
'Cause a light comes through ′em now
Sometimes a light comes through 'em now
