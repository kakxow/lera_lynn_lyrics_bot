You can play the part of a golden heart
But you know what you′ve done
You can pluck a rose while wearing cheapest clothes
But you know what you've done
You can??? while you wrecking the race
??? when you want
You stand tall on shoulders you let fall
And you know what you done
You know what you done
You can wear ′em down
You can fly the blade around
But you know what you've done
You can fake in hollywood as a big time doing good
But you know what you've done you get your way playing sick of fans, and slaves, a coward with a gun
Everybody sees you right in the???
And you know what you′ve done
You know what you′ve done
Yeah you...
You're the One
Hey you
You′re the one
You know its true
And you all know its you
You know what you done...
