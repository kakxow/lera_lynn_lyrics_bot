Silence fills the land
Alone, you and me all alone
Finally, you and me, in the rain, alone
I may love you more than ever now
Dripping and glistening
Storms are swirling round our heads
But we′re not listening
Though we absolutely could die here and now
I'm alright getting struck by lightning
Kiss my lips ka-pow
Flash floods may wash away the city
The town would watch us drown in love, so pretty
′Cause what could be a better way to die,
Just you and I, holding hands up in the sky
I may love you more than ever now
Dripping and glistening
Storms are swirling round our heads
But we're not listening
And though we absolutely could die here and now
I'm already getting struck by lightning
Kiss my lips ka-pow
Alone, you and me, finally, in the rain, alone
