And your eyes will let the truth be told

I can see a man who
Never once has truly felt that his
Good deeds and golden heart
Could outshine the dark that he was dealt

Slow motion countdown
It won′t last forever

I can see you, knife in hand
But the ropes have got you all bound down
Let rest the blade, dear
It's the struggle that keeps the tangles wound

I can see you shrinking
As we drift apart into deep space
Slow motion countdown
You′re trapped in the dark of a new moon phase

Well, it's a slow motion countdown
We're approaching zero
It′s a slow motion letdown
Love won′t be a hero

Well, it's a slow motion countdown
We′re approaching zero
It's a slow motion letdown
Love won′t be a hero
