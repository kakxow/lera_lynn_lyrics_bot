But it sounds so new this time
When the house goes dark
The truth I can't deny
We built a love to fall apart
Now the cracks have grown so wide
I can′t see to the other side

This time I'm gonna hear
What has been said so clear
This time I'm gonna hear
The same old song
The same old song

I′ve looked away so long
Been putting on the great disguise
When the pain comes up
I′m afraid of what I'll find
A face that I don′t recognize

This time I'm gonna hear
What has been said so clear
This time I′m gonna hear
The same old song
The same old song
