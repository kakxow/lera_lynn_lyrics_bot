Close your eyes climb inside
The only place that′s real
Let your mind become use to
What you want me to be

What defines the line
In between space and time
What else can you see
When they all say it's free
It′s never free

?? Like a highland silver ponies??
Watch it all go to hell
Maybe they'll be blind to why you're free to be around

What defines the line
In between whats you and i
What can I believe
When you insist its free
It′s never free

?? Feel like ribbons dance along the branches of tie rope tree??
?? Be the apparition all night but don′t dance on me??

What defines the kind
In between your truth and mine
What did I agree
?? When you walk on the street??
It's never free
