What you got ain′t a lot
It must have been a long night
It must have been a long and lonely night
You were letting go of what you got
What you got ain't a lot
Would you believe me when I say it′s true?
Would you believe me when I say it's true?
When I go, I don't want you to worry
When I go, I don′t want you to worry

I must have been the right kind
I must have been in the wrong frame of mind
I was looking for an afterthought
To take back what was lost
You must have been a little blind
Or maybe you′re just another human kind
And you keep your fingers crossed
That it's all worth the cost
Would you believe me when I say it′s true?
Would you believe me when I say it's true?
When I go, I don′t want you to worry
When I go, I don't want you to worry

Maybe it′s a good sign
We wanted the same thing, you and I
Just a little company
They set each other free
Would you believe me when I say it's true?
Would you believe me when I say it's true?
When I go, I don′t want you to worry
When I go, I don′t want you to worry
