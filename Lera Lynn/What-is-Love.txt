When I came from nothing, she made me a man of gold

I grew older and more confused
I turned a blind eye to everything I knew was true

What is love?
I don′t know
I couldn't love the one inside
So I had to let it go
Give me time
To look below
There′s a black sea underground
There's a light somewhere unknown

I've been keeping my own company
They′re all saying that the one I′m missing is me

What is love?
I don't know
I keep falling down the road
Looking for the one I never know
Show me how
To set it free
So that I can walk alone
And still have everything I need
What is love?

What is love?
What is love?
