And the photographs that I had taken of
You in our old kitchen making love
Inside and I, you′re in pain
Smell of your left smoking fingers
Bruised and bleeding all still lingers on
Inside this head of mine
And when I hear your music playing
Again I hear your sad voice saying
You were never satisfied
Oh no, you were never satisfied

Come by if you're downtown
We′ll drink and celebrate the moon
And all the things you left behind, oh woo-oo
I've forgiven you for all that you did
Still all I can do is write these letters that will never get to you, oh woo-oo

I thought I smelled your Marlboro burning
As I rinsed my hair this morning
When I called out, you weren't there
And the diesel truck the neighbor drives
Fools me into thinking you′re alive
And coming home to stay
But you were running like a chalkboard scratch
Up all night long, no turning back
Or guilt would eat your heart alive
And so you′ve left me here in pain and wonder
Regretting never pushing you like thunder coming from the gods
Oh, it might have saved you from the dark

Come by if you're downtown
We′ll drink and celebrate the moon
And all the things you left behind, oh woo-oo
I've forgiven you for all that you did
Still all I can do is write these letters that will never get to you, oh woo-oo

Come by if you′re downtown
We'll drink and celebrate the moon
And all the things you left behind, oh woo-oo
I′ve forgiven you for all that you did
Still all I can do is write these letters that will never get to you, oh woo-oo
