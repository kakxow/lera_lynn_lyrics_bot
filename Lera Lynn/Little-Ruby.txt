And that was all you wrote
No way to find you
No way to ring your little bell
What are you hidin′, you're living in a big mess
I thought you were just a pretty little waitress
Maybe you're hidin′ out from the po-lice
Maybe they′ve got you in a penitentiary
I wanna find you
I wanna make you come fast
Sweet Little Ruby, why won't you love me?
Why won′t you let me see you again?
Sweet Little Ruby, who are you really?
Why won't you let me be your friend?
I thought you were just a late night bartender
A heavy scissor handed hack job hairdresser
Maybe a mermaid, livin′ underwater
Or maybe worse, the preacher's daughter
How can I find you, I wanna′ return to sender
Sweet Little Ruby, why won't you love me?
Why won't you let me see you again?
Sweet Little Ruby, who are you really?
Why won′t you let me be your friend?
Sweet Little Ruby, why won′t you love me?
Why won't you let me see you again?
Sweet Little Ruby, who are you really?
Why won′t you let me be your friend?
