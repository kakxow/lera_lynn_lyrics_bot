Their talking shit don't show
But set foot in a new direction, they will go so low
You can think what you want but I'm a good-hearted man
Don′t you listen to their words, they don′t know who I am
Oh and let me rectify, lord I know that I still can
You can think what you want but I'm a good-hearted man
Everybody fucks around
Everybody makes choices that ain′t sound
But I mean you no harm
I'm just killing time
I′m just following the breeze that blows this heart of mine
You can think what you want but I'm a good-hearted man
Don′t you listen to their words, they don't know who I am
Oh and let me rectify, lord I know that I still can
You can think what you want but I'm a good-hearted man
Yes you can think what you want but I′m a good-hearted man
