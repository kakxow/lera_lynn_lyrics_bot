When I stare into her eyes I see no one there
Lately I'm not feeling like myself

Lately I′ve been losing all my time
All that mattered to me slipped my mind
Every time I hit another town
Strangers appear to lock me down
Lately I've been losing all my time

The mystery that no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?

Lately words are missing from now on
Vanished in the haze of love gone wrong
There's no future, there′s no past, in the present nothing lasts
Lately someone′s missing from now on
