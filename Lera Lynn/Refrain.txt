With your cold and hard refrain

Used to be you looked at me but now we hardly meet eyes
I said seems to be you've become the sea tomb, sinking head of the fire
Head of fire, head of fire
Against your cold and hard refrain

Hold me one last time
And tell me that the fault′s not mine
You're only letting go because I've asked you so
And don′t try to realize that forgotten luster of my eyes
It′s easier if you maintain your cold and hard refrain
Hold me one last time and tell me that the fault's not mine
You′re only letting go because I've asked you so
And don′t try to realize the forgotten luster of my eyes
It's easier if you maintain your cold and hard refrain
Your cold and hard, your cold and hard refrain
