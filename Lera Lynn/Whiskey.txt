Try to get back in her life again
I'm just a man, a low-down man
With a whiskey bottle in both hands
And liquored up, through I may be
There is still some loving inside of me
But I don′t know if I'm coming or going
I just keep the whiskey flowing
She'll pick up the phone and she′ll start to cry
′Cause I can't stop asking her why
She don′t love me anymore
I blame her for all the closed doors
