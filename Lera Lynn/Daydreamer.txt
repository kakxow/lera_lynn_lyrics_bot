A light that lives just out of reach
Painful brilliance

So daydreamer, dream the day away
Sit and watch the players play their silly games
Go on, daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream

Precious are the few
Strong enough to ignore the path of least resistance
Where's the simple truth
Underneath the revelry of mere existence?

So daydreamer, dream the day away (daydreamer)
Sit and watch the players play their silly games (daydreamer)
Let the blind lead the blind (daydreamer)
And dream through someone elseâ€²s eyes (daydreamer)
Go on, daydreamer, dream

Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
Daydreamer, dream
