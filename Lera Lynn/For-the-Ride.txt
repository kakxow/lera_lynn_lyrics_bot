Tumbled headfirst, steadfirst, but I feel the same
Ahhhhhh... It's not all for nothing, it's only for the ride
Like hollow words that come so fast and do no work
I been shooting at the moon but he don′t hurt
Put me in a box and toss me over the
Maybe the fish can make something more of this
Ahhhhhh... It′s not all for nothing, it's only for the ride
There′s no use pretending
My freedom I'm defending
Oh from miserable, inexcitable... love
Ahhhhhh... It′s not all for nothing, it's only for the ride
