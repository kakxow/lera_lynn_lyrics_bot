You'll apologize for leaving me so long hanging
But your eyes say you′re a lie
When we met, of my touch you got all you could get
And we dreamed of a love long and true
But just like the snow, so are you
Cold and disappearing to the blue
Well I'm hooked on you
And what can I do?

I know that you know how to love me
But your arms stay by your side
Have you found love somewhere else and are you saying
That what you see came in my eyes
When we met, of my touch you got all you could get
And we dreamed of a love long and true
Well just like the snow, so were you
Cold and disappearing to the blue
Well I'm hooked on you
And what can I do?

When we met, of my touch you got all you could get
And we dreamed of a love long and true
Well just like the snow, so were you
Cold and disappearing to the blue
I′m hooked on you
What can I do?
