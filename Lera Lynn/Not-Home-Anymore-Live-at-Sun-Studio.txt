And you the strong-willed man
We held tight
Maybe too tight
So I tried to let the distance make it right
I nearly left you before I left
We were still together
Still all right
Been drivin' back
Been three weeks gone
Though my body′s here
My heart's still gone
I parked the car
Walked through our door
I see your face and I'm not home
I′m not home anymore
I remember when we had
Just a bed
Time spent pullin′ on an endless thread
Thought I had come back
Back to just fine
Thought I'd put my faith in the space and time
I parked the car
Walked through our door
I see your face and I′m not home
I'm not home anymore
Sweetness, love, and glory
I′m sure it will turn out well
I love a good story.
I'm just tellin′ it to myself
I'm not home anymore
