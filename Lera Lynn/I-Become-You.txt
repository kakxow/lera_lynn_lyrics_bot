Make a mess of me,
You got what it takes.
In your eyes, I see
Red lights, but no brakes.
Shadows big and tall,
I don′t feel at all,
In the dark they're lying
Sharp, faint lover′s cry
Take me down,
The way you do.
Break me down,
So, I become you.

Disassemble me.
Have all I can take.
I just want to be in the loving way.
Forget the control,
Take it all too far
Just let yourself be
The animal you are.

Take me down,
The way you do.
Break me down,
Til, I become you.

(Solo)

Take me down,
The way you do.
Break me down,
Til, I become you.

Make a mess of me,
You got what it takes.
Won't you let me be
The animal you've made?
