Too much for one to hold and not to say

Come knocking on my door (I'm home, I′m home)
No, I can't wait no more (Alone, alone)

Dark horse, you don't have to hide
Dark horse, take me for a ride

See your face, get ideas for now and forever
Tell the truth, I never wanted anything more

Come knocking on my door (I′m home, I′m home)
No, I can't wait no more (Alone, alone)

Dark horse, you don′t have to hide
Dark horse, take me for a ride

Take you in, set you free, ... open
Cut you loose, ... love...

Come knocking on my door, (Come knocking on my door)
I'm home (I′m home, I'm home)
No, I can′t wait no more (No, I can't wait no more alone)
Alone (Alone)

Dark horse, you don't have to hide
Dark horse, you don′t have to hide
Dark horse, you don′t have to hide
Dark horse, you don't have to hide
(Dark horse)
