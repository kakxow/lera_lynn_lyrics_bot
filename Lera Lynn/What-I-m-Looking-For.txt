And I been chasing down a fading light

And it slips away, fades away a little more
(Look away, it is gone, oh, oh)
Fades away, every day
Still I don′t know what I'm lookin' for

I′m listening now and I wanna go
I just haven′t found the right way home
Let go the oars, I hear no one really steers
We're all just holding on to fantasy

And it slips away, fades away a little more
(Look away, it is gone, oh, oh)
Fades away every day
And I don′t know what I'm lookin′ for
Yeah, it seems so far away but I don't know what I′m lookin' for
Ooh, yeah

It slips away, fades away a little more
(Look away, it is gone, oh, oh)
Fades away every day still I don't know what I′m looking for

Now I see I′m running out of road
Head down and blind, I been driving through the night
And I been chasing down a fading light
