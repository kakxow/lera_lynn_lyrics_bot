It's not that I want to forget forever
I'll bring you back on my own
But won′t you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone

There′s no open invitation
No wide open door
So if you don't mind coming out from behind the pantry door
Stop pacing the floor
It′s not that I want to forget forever
I'll bring you back on my own
But won′t you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone
Won't you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone

He′s riding in the car
He's underneath the bed
He's walking the streets around here
His hand on my shoulder
His whisper in my ear
He′s gone but he will never go
You′re gone but you will never go

It's not that I want to forget forever
I′ll bring you back on my own
But won't you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone
Won′t you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone
Won't you please leave it up to me
The nights I am alone
