And a lifetime goes up in smoke

This is my least favorite you
Who floats far above earth and stone
The nights that I twist on the rack
Is the time that I feel most at home

We wandering in the shade
And the rustle of falling leaves
A bird on the edge of a blade
Lost now forever
My love, in a sweet memory

The station pulls away from the train
The blue pulls away from the sky
The whisper of two broken wings
May be they're yours, maybe theyâ€²re mine

This is my least favorite life
The one where I am out of my mind
The one where you are just out of reach
The one where I stay and you fly

I am wandering in the shade
And the rustle of falling leaves
A bird on the edge of the blade
Lost now forever
My love, in a sweet memory
