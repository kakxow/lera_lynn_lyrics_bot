There's no need to stay here, there's nothing that you can do now

I know I neglect them
I hurt them and cheat them but surely they can see
There′s more at work here than just the danger and really, it′s not me
Let this be the last time that I see your face in my town
I hate your sad song and really I am comin' down
Comin′ down

Please leave me be
I heard you this time this could be the end of me
Let this be the last time that I see your face in my town
I have unstitched myself in the best way I know how
Please leave me be
I hate your sad song and really I am comin' down
Comin′ down, comin' down, comin′ down
Please leave me be
I heard you this time, this could be the end of me
