Dusty books and quiet dreams
Pictures on a mantel
Speak your name
Softly like forgotten tunes just
Outside the sound of pain

Weren′t we like a pair of thieves
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You cannot take that from me
My small reprieves
Your heart of gold
Weren't we like a battlefield
Locked inside a holy war
Your love and my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for

Change will come to those who
Have no fear
But I′m not her, you never were
The kind who kept a rule book near
What I said was never
What I meant
And now you've seen my world in flames my
Shadow songs my deep regrets

Weren't we like a pair of thieves
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You cannot take that from me
My small reprieves
Your heart of gold
Weren′t we like a battlefield
Locked inside a holy war
Your love and my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for
