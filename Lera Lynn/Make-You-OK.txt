Some days you'd show up all redesigned

I remember you sometimes let come undone
I′d sing and you couldn't help but let tears run
And it felt to me like heaven had opened the skies
A man so harsh and heavy letting love pour from his eyes

I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh, why couldn't I make you okay?

In a melody you were finally free
You′d forget the guilt and for a moment see me
These days I′m singing, searching all the eyes
For that same freedom, I am too deprived

I didn't get it then but I sure do now
And I′m terrified I'm becoming you somehow
And everyone I ever love just gets dragged around
Hanging on to promises of higher ground

But I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh, why couldn′t I make you okay?

I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh, why couldn't I make you okay?

Oh, why couldn′t I make you okay?
