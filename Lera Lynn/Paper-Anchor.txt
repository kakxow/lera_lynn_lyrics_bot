They′re just direct lines to happy lies
'Cause I find my home in the arms of strangers
I find love in the way of danger
A drunk man′s daughter and a child of anger
A dead man's haunted, a paper anchor
It's a mistake to love me, darling, you′ve always known
The axe does fall when hips get sewn
But I′ll keep my teeth in your neck if you can hang on
I'll suck the life out ′til it's all gone
