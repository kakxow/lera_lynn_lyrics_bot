Your voice in my left ear
Says there′s no danger here
And trust the feeling all the way back down
Welcome to the crimson underground

Well I can see, it don't feel right
Hanging on with all your might
Let go of all control
You're allowed to free your soul
And trust, my love, lay that burden down
Welcome to the crimson underground

I hear your voice, it′s like a song for me
You have no choice, for you belong to me
Let darkness join together, you and I forever
And go on and break the spirit down
Welcome to the crimson underground
Welcome to the crimson underground
