It′ll eat you clean of hope and trust

I'll tell you something kid, if I was you I'd run
Straight to the other side to full-time job and part-time fun
And you can save yourself the struggle, the climb-up jig-saw puzzle
The never knowing how to hustle, only how to get yourself in trouble

Oh, if I was you

I′d try for the simple life
Just love and sleeping through the night
I′d play it on the safer side
Keep it simple, babe, make it easy

I'll tell you something kid, you′re certainly ambitious
But if I was you I'd get a useful job in maybe business
What you feel don′t matter, everybody's got something to say
But nobody′s got the time to listen to it anyway

And I'll tell you something else, time will set you free
No more caring what they think, no more chasing your vanity
But if you ever get the chance to slip through the cracks
Well, take that money straight to the bank, baby
No never ever look back, hmm

Still, if I was you

I'd try for the simple life
Just love and sleeping through the night
I′d play it on the safer side
Keep it simple, babe, make it easy

Still, if I was you

I′d try for the simple life
Just love and sleeping through the night
I'd play it on the safer side
Keep it simple, babe, make it easy
Keep it simple, babe, make it easy
