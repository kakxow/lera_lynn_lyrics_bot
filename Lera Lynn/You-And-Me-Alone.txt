Silence fills the???
Alone, you and me all alone
Finally you and me in the rain alone

I may love you more than ever now
Dripping and glistening
Storms are swirling round our heads
But we′re not listening
Though we absolutely could die here, and now
I'm alright getting struck by lightening
Kiss my lips, kapow
Alone, you and me finally in the rain alone

Flash floods may wash away the city
The town would watch us drown in love so pretty
But would could be a better way to die, just you and I, holding hands up in the sky

I may love you more than ever now
Dripping and glistening
Storms are swirling round our heads
But we′re not listening
Though we absolutely could die here, and now
I'm alright getting struck by lightening
Kiss my lips, kapow
Alone, you and me finally in the rain alone.
