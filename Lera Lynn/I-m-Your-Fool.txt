Darts are falling on me from above
I could die in your arms
You wouldn′t even be alarmed
I could drown in your glass of wine
You'd never know the face was mine
I'm your fool

Six lanes of traffic rolling on
Throwing myself straight into the wind
I′ll flip or flop, I′ll jump and tumble
Anything for you to let me in
I could die in your arms
You wouldn't even be alarmed
I could drown in your glass of wine
You′d never know the face was mine
I'm your fool
I′m your fool
