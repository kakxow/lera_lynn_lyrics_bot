I wanna miss you lonely as a desert sea
Sparkle like a star, stranger in a faraway land
Pockets tall his hands up, feet stock right where he stands
Divide grows wide, between work in one southern man

One hand holds the post, the other is still in wind
On one hand it′s his curse, on the other it's what it′s real

I shine bright, like the wide, wide world
When you're STANDING ON THE MOON
She could be just standing gold
Your hands are tied, but your heart is free
If you learn to cut the rope
Please make your way to me

I won't show you love, you take my hand
You can find satisfaction being the one remembered
I wanna love you, I don′t wanna know where I stand
Between your heart, the road, and all of the needs of a man

One hand holds the post, the other is still in wind
On one hand it′s his curse, on the other it's what it′s real

I shine bright, like the wide, wide world
When you're STANDING ON THE MOON
She could be just standing gold
Your hands are tied, but your heart is free
If you learn to cut the rope
Please make your way to me

When you hand you had on???
Will you hand me had in chain?
When you say but it′s impossible
You're just running away
From the thing that kept you tied down
The thing that gives you freedom
Go climb!

I shine bright, like the wide, wide world
When you′re STANDING ON THE MOON
She could be just standing gold
Your hands are tied, but your heart is free
If you learn to cut the rope
Please make your way to me
If you learn to cut the rope
Please make your way to me
