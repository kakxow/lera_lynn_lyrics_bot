He was a liar but not a tone
Still he went to your head
He said, I love you baby like a miner loves gold,
And this will never grow old
Lost in the ether, down in the blind
And not a word was said
But he was neither, vicious or kind
As he laid there and bled
His hands were on you and it felt just the same
As when he didnâ€²t know your name
And he said, I love you baby like a miner loves gold
And this will never grow old
Darkness for cover
Church in ruin
There's nothing left to feel
Goodbye lover, this is your doing
A heart against the wheel
