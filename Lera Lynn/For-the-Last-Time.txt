If you make it you′ll be back again
To travel that way reverse
Father forgive my sins, let me in
Ooo, ooo
Aaa, aaa

They'll roll her down the hall tonight
For the last time

Nearly a century done-love, life, gain, loss
Which way you stumble, take your spin and coin does toss
It's a rough road on this way out
But there′s a passage in there, no doubt
And I′m told the bottom
Is well worth this longer route, this longer route
Ooo, ooo
Aaa, aaa

They'll roll her down the hall tonight
For the last time

She′s seen enough to know grace and bow out
All paperwork is notarized you should have, no doubts
We'll scramble the dilly cue
We′ll find there ain't much to do
She′s gonna lie down with him
Love like they used to, like the used to

They'll roll her down the hall tonight
They'll roll her out of sight tonight
For the last time
Ooo, ooo
Aaa, aaa
Ooo, ooo
