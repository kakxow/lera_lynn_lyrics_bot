I′ll not walk again
Gunpowder black within

I cast my soul into a silver bullet, babe
A fine metal for our last dance let justice make its case
Satisfaction, mine to feel
Traveling through space
Faster than the speed of sound
Winning your heart's race

A wide open vein
There's nothing left but pain
You waved your flag red
You turned light to lead

Charcoal for nerves
You drained me of my color
No more passe
Horns out all the way

I cast my soul into a silver bullet, babe
A fine metal for our last dance let justice make its case
Satisfaction, mine to feel
Traveling through space
Faster than the speed of sound
Winning your heart′s race

I cast my soul into a silver bullet, babe
A fine metal for our last dance let justice make its case
Satisfaction, mine to feel
Traveling through space
Faster than the speed of sound
Winning your heart′s race
