We're all sailing in a fog on a sea of rat race hell

I don't waste my time anymore
Tryin′ to bait the line, ′cause what for?
Some days I do nothing at all
Close up the blinds, smoke weed and screen all of my calls

'Cause, it doesn′t matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn′t matter, it doesn't matter at all

Somehow we′ve all come to believe that we
Need so much more than we really need
And yes, I know that you've heard it all before
But some days you need to hear it some more

But it doesn't matter, but it doesn′t matter
It doesn′t matter, it doesn't matter
I doubt it matters, it doesn′t matter at all

And meanwhile, sweet fruit left behind
Passing off the reins of your own mind

But it doesn't matter, it doesn′t matter, yeah
It doesn't matter, it doesn′t matter
It doesn't matter, no, I doubt it matters at all
