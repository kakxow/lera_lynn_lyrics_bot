With your hungry now artistic titterwhirl[?]
Your not the one who's gonna spend your days
Lying in the sun

Girl you should forget the feeling
Bite your tongue so you can get through reeling
Maybe those modern house figures
With their custom make a wish triggers
Maybe the place where they can spend your days
Lying in the sun

Girl you gotta hear the sound
When the suited dogs release the hounds
A free for all you can eat dumpster dive
With a greasy palm green colored high fives
Youâ€²re not the one who's gonna play me babes
Lying in the sun
