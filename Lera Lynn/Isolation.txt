Old-fashioned rendezvous, the New-Age spirit quest

Isolation, romance the stone with
Information, pick up the phone
Can anybody hear me? Is there anyone there?

The lost art of touch, the voyeuristic plague
Junk-food melodies stroke your hidden rage
Hands-free reality, pleasure is a must
When itâ€²s just you and machine, there's no need for trust

Isolation, no place like home
Validation, throw me a bone
Can anybody hear me? Is there anyone there?
Can anybody hear me? Is there anyone there?

And when the gold wears off, what
What will we be?
Just a mix of metals at the bottom of the sea
Alone at the bottom of the sea (alone)

Isolation, romance the stone with
Information, pick up the phone
Can anybody hear me? Is there anyone there?
Can anybody hear me? Is there anyone there?
