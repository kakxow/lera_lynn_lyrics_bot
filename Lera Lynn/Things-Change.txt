But it's not out of out hands, not out of reach

Things change, hearts change
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same
Things change, hearts change
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same

Can′t wish it, wish it, wish it, can't just wish it well
Can't medicate the day away forever
There′s no winning what you have withheld
And no seeing what you keep veiled
And no holding love when it′s gone

Things change, hearts change
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same
Things change, oh and hearts change
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same

You're a shooter and aim to kill
Then whisper the pain away
I′ll be your hunter so you can feel
What it means to be prey
You're a shooter and you aim to kill
And whisper the pain away
I′ll be your hunter so you can feel
What it means to be prey

Things change, hearts change
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same
Nothing stays the same, nothing stays the same
