I don't ever count ′em 'cause
I'm surrounded by your love
Days are never long enough

Four more seasons on parade
Show their colours, then they fade
But that won′t happen to us, darlin′
We'll remember how it was
Then begin again because
Days are never long enough

Time′s never late
Isn't bound by our fate
Try as we may
Love might never be found if we wait
Until the sun comes up
On another day, my love
Days are never long enough

Time′s never late
Isn't bound by our fate
Try as we may
Love might never be found if we wait
Until the sun comes up
On another day, my love
Days are never long enough
