Aching bodies, swimming head, a heart thatâ€²s lost at sea
If someone came to rescue it, I doubt that it'd be me

Clouded eyes, your setting sun
Decide who you will be
But there's still time to make the trek and light by which to see
Heart of gold and intention will never set you free
Most ears refuse to hear the truth
Most eyes refuse to see
