I try to keep my distance
While you're betting your world
I′d never wanna tangle up
Me and you and your perfect girl
'Cause I'm not a perfect girl

In another life wise and full of time
In another life you′re mine

I reset the memory of us in Central park
A dream that ended much too soon, together after dark
It′s getting harder to pretend
That I'm just your little friend

In another life wise and full of time
In another life you′re mine
In another life this love's not such a crime
In another life you′re mine

Now there is no end
We'll just start again
Next time around
Or even now

In another life wise and full of time
In another life you′re mine
In another life this love's not such a crime
In another life you're mine
You′re mine
You′re mine
