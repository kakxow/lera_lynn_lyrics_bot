I heard you′re in the charts
I like your latest song
I like to sing along

But I don't want nothing to do with your love
I don't want to be the boost to your song
I don′t want nothing to do
Nothing to do with your
Love, love, love, love

I′ve seen you on stage two
I've seen you whip the room
You proved me right along
Can make my heart turn blue
I read your last CD
I dubbed the melodies

But I don′t want nothing to do with your love
I don't want to be the boost to your song
I don′t want nothing to do
Nothing to do with your
Love, love, love, love

If we were to collide
Diamonds will turn to dust
But how can we deny the sweet taste of self destruct?

I don't want nothing to do with your love
I don′t want to be the boost to your song
I don't want nothing to do
Nothing to do with your
Love,
Love, love, love, love
Your love
